# Hospital-Database-Analytics (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital operational data and create an interactive Power BI dashboard. This helps hospital management understand patient trends, departmental performance, and financial KPIs, enabling better decision-making and improved efficiency.

## Data used
 <a href = "https://github.com/shivaprasadreddyanukula47/Hospital-Database-Analytics-Dashboard/tree/main">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs / Insights)
551K – Total Revenue generated through treatments and services.

2.76K – Average Cost per Patient

200 – Total Appointments recorded

45 – Average Patient Age

These KPIs are powered through DAX measures for dynamic calculation and filtering.
 Major Insights From the Dashboard
1. Treatment Cost Analysis
Chemotherapy (129K), MRI (116K), and X-Ray (111K) contribute the highest revenue.
Physiotherapy and ECG follow with moderate revenue levels.
This helps identify the top-earning treatment categories.

2. Gender-wise Revenue Contribution
Male patients contribute 66% of total revenue.
Female patients contribute 34%.
This highlights the patient demographic distribution in spending.

3. Monthly Revenue Analysis
Revenue fluctuates month-to-month, with strong performance in months like April, January, and May.
This helps the hospital track seasonal or operational trends across the year.

5. Payment Status Breakdown
Payments split across Pending, Failed, and Paid categories.
This helps finance teams identify gaps in payment recovery.

6. Reasons for Visit
Highest visits come from:
Checkup (45)
Consultation (43)
Therapy (42)
Follow-up (41)
Emergency cases (29)
This helps understand what services bring the most footfall.

7. Doctor Specialization Distribution
Highest number of doctors are in Pediatrics (5), followed by Dermatology (3) and Oncology (2).
This supports workforce planning and specialization balancing.

## Process:
I cleaned and prepared the hospital data, built the data model.
created DAX measures for key metrics, and designed an interactive Power BI dashboard
To visualize revenue, appointments, treatment insights, and patient demographics.

## Final Project Summary

This Power BI Hospital Dashboard delivers a clear, actionable view of hospital performance using dynamic DAX-driven KPIs, visual trends, and category-wise analysis. It helps management understand revenue drivers, patient behavior, demand for treatments, and department-level performance—leading to better planning and improved patient service outcomes.
